               <ul>
                  <li>1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter</li>
                  <li>2 cups graham cracker crumbs (from about 18 whole crackers)</li>
                  <li>3 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
                  <li>A pinch of fine salt</li>
                  <li>&frac14; teaspoon each: ground ginger and ground cinnamon</li>
               </ul>

               <ul>

                  <li>1 &frac14; cups brown sugar</li>

                  <li>&frac12; cup heavy cream</li>
                  <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                  <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
                  <li>&frac34; pumpkin pur&eacute;e</li>
                  <li>1 and &frac12; teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>

               </ul>
               <h4>Topping:</h4>
               <ul>
                  <li>&frac34; cup heavy cream</li>
                  <li>2 tablespoons confectioners&rsquo; sugar</li>

               <h3 class="sectionHeader">Steps</h3>
               <ol>
                  <li>Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350&deg; F.</li>
                  <li><strong>Make the crust:</strong> Using a food processor, pulse the graham crackers into crumbs. Pour into a medium bowl and stir in ginger, cinnamon, sugar, salt, and melted butter until combined and mixture is like wet sand. Press firmly into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a 9-inch or 10-inch springform pan. No need to grease the pan first. Pre-bake for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and place the hot pan on a large piece of aluminum foil. Allow crust to slightly cool as you prepare the filling.</li>
                  <li><strong>Make the filling:</strong> Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and brown sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream and vanilla extract, then beat until fully combined. On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition until just blended. After the final egg is incorporated into the batter, stop mixing. To help prevent the cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it cools, avoid over-mixing the batter as best you can.</li>
                  <li>Scoop out 2 cups of batter and place in a medium mixing bowl. Stir in the pumpkin pur&eacute;e, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice until combined. Begin adding spoonfuls of each batter, the plain and the pumpkin, on top of the crust. Alternate until all the batter is used and pan is filled. Using a toothpick or knife, swirl the batters together by dragging the toothpick top to bottom, then left to right.</li>
                  <li>Reduce the oven temperature to 325&deg; F.</li>
                  <li>Bake the pie for 50â€“55 minutes or until the filling is <em>almost</em> fully set with a little wobble in the very center. Give the pie a light tap to check. During bake time, if the pie is browning too quickly on top and around the edges, tent with aluminum foil.</li>
                  <li>Set the pie on a wire rack and cool for 1 hour at room temperature. Then place it in the refrigerator and chill for at least 2 hours and up to 2 days before serving. (Cover if chilling it for longer than a few hours.)</li>
                  <li><strong>For the topping:</strong> Right before serving, whisk together the heavy cream and confectioners&rsquo; sugar in a large bowl until medium-stiff peaks. Top the cheesecake with the whipped cream, a few swirls of caramel sauce, and leftover graham cracker crumbs.</li>
